# 🧠 Deep Learning From Scratch & Projects

This repository contains my **deep learning learning journey**, where I implement:

- 🔹 Deep learning concepts **from scratch using NumPy & Pytorch**
- 🔹 Core algorithms and training loops
- 🔹 Small deep learning projects
- 🔹 Experiments with activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers


The main goal of this repository is to **understand deep learning at a low level**.
